fun_with_physics_models
=======================

Having recently found the ipywidgets library developed by Jake Vanderplas, I've been using it to make simple interactive plots to display physics or math concepts. I've implemented a couple of examples so far such as the temperature dependent blackbody radiation spectrum, the diffraction pattern from slits of various shapes etc. More to come.

* add the relevant theory/context to each of the notebooks.

* a simulation of how a quasar spectrum will look in redshift space and how the colors in various bands, u, g, r, i & z, will change wrt redshift.
* the radial probability distrubution functions of an electron in the 1s, 2s, 2p and so on shells.
* the 4f optical fourier processor and spatial fourier transform + analysis + bandpass

* learn how to create multiple plots/ subplots, all of which behave interaactively to the cursor/slider!

http://www.myphysicslab.com/index.html looks like a good list of simple physics simulations
