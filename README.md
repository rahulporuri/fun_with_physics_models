fun_with_physics_models
=======================

Having recently found the ipywidgets library developed by Jake Vanderplas, I've been using it to make simple interactive plots to display physics or math concepts. I've implemented a couple of examples so far such as the temperature dependent blackbody radiation spectrum, the diffraction pattern from slits of various shapes etc. More to come.

-> given the fact that the .ipynb notebooks support equations written in latex, I need to add the relevant theory/context to each of the notebooks. and reconvert them to html files.
-> a simulation of how a quasar spectrum will look in redshift space and how the colors in various bands, u, g, r, i & z, will change wrt redshift.
-> the amplitude of a harmonic oscillator, damped oscillator and a damped-driven oscillator. for various k (force constant) and gamma (damping coefficient)
-> the radial probability distrubution functions of an electron in the 1s, 2s, 2p and so on shells.
-> the 4f optical fourier processor and spatial fourier transform + analysis + bandpass

http://www.myphysicslab.com/index.html looks like a good list of simple physics simulations
