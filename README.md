fun_with_physics_models
=======================

Having recently found the ipywidgets library developed by Jake Vanderplas, I've been using it to make simple interactive plots to display physics or math concepts. I've implemented a couple of examples so far such as the temperature dependent blackbody radiation spectrum, the diffraction pattern from slits of various shapes etc. More to come. You can access the ipython notebooks [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rahulporuri/fun_with_physics_models/tree/master/), at nbviewer online! You can also view them online, as html files [here](http://rahulporuri.github.io/blog.html).

(working) visualizations
====
* Blackbody radiation
* chirped pulses
* christoffel symbols
* simple and damped harmonic oscillator
* diffraction limit
* diffusion
* etalon transmittance
* gain profile
* mode locking
* motion of charged particle in electric and magnetic fields
* resolution limit
* standing waves
* summation of higher harmonics
* superposition of waves
* travelling waves

to-do
===

* add the relevant theory/context to each of the notebooks.

* a simulation of how a quasar spectrum will look in redshift space and how the colors in various bands, u, g, r, i & z, will change wrt redshift.
* the radial probability distrubution functions of an electron in the 1s, 2s, 2p and so on shells.
* the 4f optical fourier processor and spatial fourier transform + analysis + bandpass

done
===

* learn how to create multiple plots/ subplots, all of which behave interaactively to the cursor/slider!

http://www.myphysicslab.com/index.html looks like a good list of simple physics simulations
