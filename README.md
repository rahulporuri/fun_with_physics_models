fun_with_physics_models
=======================

Having recently found the ipywidgets library developed by Jake Vanderplas, I've been using it to make simple interactive plots to display physics or math concepts. I've implemented a couple of examples so far such as the temperature dependent blackbody radiation spectrum, the diffraction pattern from slits of various shapes etc. More to come.
